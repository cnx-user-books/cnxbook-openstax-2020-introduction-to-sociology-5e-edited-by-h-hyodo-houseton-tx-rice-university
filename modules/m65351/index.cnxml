Chances are, however, their limited personal experiences and knowledge and socially shared prejudice/stereotypes tend to lead them to views more or less biased. To check your own view, for example, answer this question: What percent of Americans today believe that it is sometimes necessary to discipline a child with a good, hard spanking?</para><para id="eip-933"><media id="image" alt="spanking"> <image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/spanking.png" width="450"/> </media></para><para id="eip-503">Here is the answer. Between 2000 and 2016, 71% of respondents in a series of surveys conducted in the U.S. (n=13,038) said they believed spanking was necessary (The General Social Survey 2016). Is this answer, based on the empirical data, close to your guessing?</para><para id="eip-137">In order to understand what a given phenomenon is <emphasis effect="italics">actually</emphasis> like, social scientists (including sociologists, of course) conduct research to gather data (empirical evidence) related to the phenomenon in question, in systematic fashion.
