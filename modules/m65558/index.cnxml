        <para id="import-auto-id1309555">Madame Jeanne Calment of France was the world's oldest  living person until she died at 122 years old; there are currently six women in the world whose ages are well documented as 115 years or older (Diebel 2014).</para><para id="import-auto-id2185528">People who lived for 100 years are called <term>centenarians</term>. In 2010, there were about 80,000 centenarians in the United States alone. They make up one of the fastest-growing segments of the population (Boston University School of Medicine 2014). </para><para id="eip-983">The older population is defined as age 65 or above. As of 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 14.1% of the total U.S. population is 65 years old or older. </para><para id="eip-868">Japan is home to the oldest citizenry in the world, with 28.4% of its population being 65 years of age or older in 2018 (Japan Times 2019). The number of Japanese aged 90 or older reached 2.31 million, including over 71,000 centenarians, close to that in the U.S. (80,000), although the Japanese population is about one third of the U.S. population. Italy is currently the second most aged society, with above 23% of its population being 65 or older, and Portugal which came third, it is 22.4%.</para><para id="eip-85">People nowadays live way longer than before. Is that a happy thing? It used to be so. But today, it's not necessarily so. This chapter introduces the aging issues taking place in various forms, be they physical, economic, social, psychological, and so on.</para><figure id="import-auto-id1748195" class="splash"><media id="import-auto-id1314604" alt="A photo of an old man sitting on a couch eating an ice cream cone with a walker next to him ">
