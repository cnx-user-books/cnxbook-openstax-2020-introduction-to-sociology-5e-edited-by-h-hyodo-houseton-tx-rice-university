        <caption>In 2011, thousands of Yemeni citizens demonstrated in the streets and protested political repression by their government (Photo courtesy of flickr)</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1493875">The so-called "Arab Spring," which caught the world attention in 2011, was a series of political uprisings in several Islamic countries, including Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia, Qatar, and Yemen. The extent of protest, which was said to be organized through social networking by ordinary citizens, varied widely among these countries. In some places, violent events took place. In Libya, its leader Muammar Gaddafi was assassinated, which was videotaped and broadcast. Backed by Russia, by contrast, Bashar Hafez al-Assad of Syria keeps weathering the revolution.</para><para id="eip-812">The U.S. major media outlets excitedly reported the "Arab Spring" in very much positive lens, calling it the democratic movements simultaneously widespread in these Islamic countries. The New York Times wrote, for example, "The light from the Arab Spring rose from the ground up" (2011). </para><para id="eip-846">Some scholars and journalists outside of the major media, however, suspect if this was actually led by ordinary citizens. Based upon a full of evidence, some of them point out that the Arab Spring was actually funded and orchestrated by the CIA, State Department, and historic CIA-funded foundations (AhamedBensaada.com 2015). According to them, the U.S. goal was to replace the political leaders unfriendly to the U.S. with those functioning for U.S. corporate and foreign policy interests.</para><para id="eip-432">What the "Arab Spring" actually meant remains to be under the thick darkness. But at least, we need to pay attention also to the voice raised outside of the major media outlets that are (remember?) owned by a few economically and politically powerful people. THAT'S POLITICS!</para><section id="fs-id1938690" class="references" type="references">
